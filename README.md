# post-me
Hi, welcome to my readme. 
This is the backend API of a social media app called post-it.
To start this code. Please use the 'npm run start command.

Firstly, I'd to write about the deleted post-its. For this I implemented a soft delete approach where I set an isDeleted flag to true instead of permanently deleting the post-it. This way, I can still keep track of the post-it and its associated replies for record-keeping purposes while hiding it from users.
